  h1 About Sabrina Sew &amp; Sew
  p Hello! Welcome to my pretty little page and thanks for checking me out! You're here for a reason so without further ado, here are few things about yours truly:

  p I am self-taught through research, trial, and error. I interned with 
    a(href="http://www.jinxedaposed.com/" target="_blank") Jinxedaposed Clothing
    |  for a year sewing and assisting for photoshoots, runways, and stage performances. My skills include sewing, crafting, prop making, wardrobe, styling, altering, costumes, and project cheerleader. (Not in a particular order.)
  
  p I am a lover of all things shiny, especially fabrics. I see the beauty in everything and love to embellish it. Repurposeing and altering clothes give me joy.

  p I am passionate about clothing, because to me it is a costume of expression. Clothes make a first impression before you can open your mouth to speak. Your style is who you are that day; the world is your stage.  Accessories can make or break it. Artfully and carefully put together, clothes will tell a story.

  p My clients would say that I am meticulous and very detail oriented. I take my time and create solid work. I have repeat clients and the promise of new clients returning for more. 

  p I love when clients come to me with a budget and an idea. A curiosity to try new things or an adventurous spirit in location to bring their visions to life. I am inspired by others passion for projects. I love anything theatrical, dreamlike, or ethereal.

        em When my wife Amy and I decided to get married, we automatically thought of asking Sabrina to make our dresses. Not just because she is our friend, but because of her extraordinary talent. Though the task of creating two custom wedding dresses was quite large, our confidence in her never wavered. She's a total pro. We couldn't be more pleased. Thank you so much, Sabrina!
